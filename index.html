    Our latest paper is now live on the <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/qss_a_00007">Quantitative Science Studies web page</a>.
    A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08738">preprint</a> is on ArXiv.
    </p> -->

	    <p> <a href="https://github.com/NETESOLUTIONS/ERNIE">ERNIE (Enhanced Research Network Informatics Environment)</a> originates
	      from a thought experiment (Williams et al. Cell 163:21-23, 2015) that we subsequently developed
	      into a knowledge resource for research assessment. Emphasis is placed on the use of Open Source technologies</p>

	    <p> From one perspective, ERNIE is a data platform that enables the discovery and analysis of collaborative research networks that underlie
	      scientific innovations that impact society and individual health. From another, ERNIE aggregates
	      diverse data for discovery and enables multidimensional measurements of research achievements. Conceptually, ERNIE aligns
	      with Siebel's 
	      <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Digital-Transformation/Thomas-M-Siebel/9781948122481">digital transformation</a>
	      doctrine. </p>

	    <p> The platform  is designed and developed by NETELabs, an experimental  research unit within
	      <a href="https://www.nete.com">NET ESolutions Corporation (NETE)</a>. ERNIE is funded in part by a Fast
	      Track Small Business Innovative Research award from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health,
	      US Department of Health and Human Services. Phase I was completed in Feb, 2018. Phase II commenced on Sept 30, 2018 and
	      is focused on building a user community and 'productionizing' the platform.</p>

	    Data in ERNIE are from both publicly available and commercial sources. Server
	    infrastructure, custom ETL processes, and data curation workflows are in place.
	    In its first phase of development, ERNIE
	    was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/371955">tested</a> in case studies spanning
	    drug development, medical devices/diagnostics, behavioral interventions, and solutions
	    for drug discovery. These case studies focused on substance abuse and  relied on our
	    core workflow consisting of data mining, linking, and network analysis.</p>

	    <p>An important event in 2019 was formalizing a partnering agreement with
	      <a href="https://www.elsevier.com">Elsevier</a>, which resulted in transition of
	      ERNIE's bibliographic backbone from the Web of Science to Scopus.
	      Similarly for patents, we now use IPDD from
	      <a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/gateway.page">Lexis-Nexis</a> instead of the
	      Derwent Patent Citation Index, which we previously used.</p>

            <p>The project philosophy is an amalgam of academic-style research and industry-style
              development by a multidisciplinary team embracing agile practices. Diversity in training
	      and life experience is a feature of this group and we believe that it plays a significant
	      and positive role in the way we operate. Data Engineers (DEs), the frontline employees in
	      our group, are typically just out of a Master's degree and are hired on short term contracts.
	      They are expected to become rapidly productive after joining the team, contribute
	      substantially during their tenure, and then find employment elsewhere with
	      substantially increased material benefits (below).

	    <p>Our DEs have come from various schools including the University
	      of Southern California, University of Virginia, University of Maryland, University of
	      California Berkeley, Institut d'EÃÅtude Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po), University
	      of Massachusetts Lowell, College of William and Mary, and Columbia University. They
	      have diverse educational backgrounds: systems engineering, mathematics, computer science,
               business analytics, industrial engineering, and philosophy.

             <p>The two senior data architects who have
	       contributed to this project over twenty years of industrial experience each at IBM, Price Waterhouse Cooper,
	       OpenText, Capital One, and were trained at Peking University and Moscow State University respectively. The
	       project leader has a background in biochemistry, immunology, peer review and program administration at The
	       Ohio State University, Washington University School of Medicine, and NIH. 

   <p> Members of the ERNIE team (present and past) are listed below with their current affiliations along with others who contributed in various
    measures to development and implementation of the concept.
