                Deep collaboration networks underlie scientific innovations that impact society and individual health. 
		<a href="https://github.com/NETESOLUTIONS/ERNIE">ERNIE (Enhanced Research Network Informatics Environment)</a> 
		is a data platform with workflows and models that enables the discovery and analysis of these networks 
		in scientific research. ERNIE  derives from a thought experiment (Williams et al. Cell 163:21-23, 2015) that we built upon
		and  has since grown into a knowledge resource for research assessment that (i) aggregates diverse data for discovery 
		(ii) enables multidimensional measurements of research achievements. ERNIE is designed and
                developed by <a href="https://www.nete.com">NET ESolutions Corporation (NETE)</a>. The project has been
                funded in part as a Fast Track Small Business Innovative Research award with Federal funds
                from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health, US Department of Health and Human
                Services. Phase I was completedin Feb, 2018.  Phase II commenced on Sept 30, 2018.
                Phase II is focused on building a user community and 'productionizing' the platform. </p>

            <p>Emphasis is placed on the use of Open Source technologies. The data in ERNIE are drawn in through custom ETL
                processes from both publicly available and commercial sources. Initial server infrastructure has been set up,
                core data have been scraped, leased, parsed, loaded, and partially curated and beta-user studies are under
                way. The project team will add additional data sources as and when they become available. Both the infrastructure
                and data model are continuously upgraded as we add new data sources and prune out less useful ones.</p>

            <p> In its first phase of development, ERNIE was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/371955">tested</a> in 
	      case studies spanning drug development, medical devices/diagnostics, behavioral interventions, and 
	      solutions for drug discovery. These case studies focused on substance abuse and  relied on our core workflow 
	      consisting of data mining, linking, and network analysis.</p>

            <p>We recently formalized a partnering agreement with <a href="https://www.elsevier.com">Elsevier</a> and by 
	      July 1, 2019 we will have completed transition from Web of Science to Scopus as the bibliographic backbone
                of ERNIE. Similarly for patents, we will be using IPDD from <a
                    href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/gateway.page">Lexis-Nexis</a> instead of the Derwent Patent
                Citation Index, which we were previously using.</p>

            <p>The project philosophy is an amalgam of academic-style research and industry-style development by a
                multidisciplinary team embracing agile practices. Data Engineers, the frontline employees in our group, are
                typically just out of a Master's degree and are hired on one year contracts. They are expected to become
                productive within 60 days of joining the team, contribute substantially for the remaining 10 months, and
                eventually progress to an external position with substantially increased material benefits (below). Our Data
                Engineers have come to us from the University of Southern California, University of Virginia, University of
                Maryland, University of California Berkeley, Institut d'EÃÅtude Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po), University
                of Massachusetts Lowell, College of William and Mary, and Columbia University. The Data Engineers in our
                group are drawn from diverse educational backgrounds: systems engineering, mathematics, computer science,
                business analytics, industrial engineering, and philosophy. The two senior data architects who have
                contributed to this project over twenty years of industrial experience each in firms like IBM, OpenText, and
                Price Waterhouse Cooper and were trained at Peking University and Moscow State University respectively. The
                project leader has a background in biochemistry, immunology, peer review and program administration at The
                Ohio State University, Washington University School of Medicine, and NIH. Thus, diversity in training and
                life experience is a feature of this group and we believe that it plays a significant and positive role in
                the way we operate.</p>

            Members of the ERNIE team (present and past) are listed below along with others who contributed in various
            measures to development and implementation of the concept.
